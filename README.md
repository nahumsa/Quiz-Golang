# Quiz on the command line using Golang

In this exercise, based on the [Gophercises](https://github.com/gophercises/quiz), I implemented a quiz game on the command line using Go.

Flags: 
 - "csv": Used for specifying your .csv file for the quiz. (default = 'questions.csv')
 - "limit": Choose the time limit of your quiz in seconds. (default = 30)
 - "shuffle": Choose if you want the questions shuffled on every run. (default = true)
